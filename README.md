# 🎁 SKU Code Generator for Corporate Gifting Site

This project was developed during my internship at **11Milliondream Consultancy Services**. It is a full-stack web application built to automate inventory management for a corporate gifting platform by dynamically generating **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) codes**. This ensures better organization, quick stock identification, and improved product showcasing, including robust security using access control.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Efficient inventory management is crucial for growing businesses. Manually generating SKU codes is not only tedious but also error-prone. The **SKU Code Generator** tackles this challenge by automating the process, assigning structured and unique identifiers to each product, and making stock tracking seamless and scalable.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔹 **Automated SKU Generation**: Automatically generates structured and unique SKU codes for every product.
- 🔹 **MERN Stack Integration**: Built with **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**.
- 🔹 **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes **JWT (JSON Web Token)** and **bcrypt hashing** for robust security.
- 🔹 **Modern Responsive UI**: Crafted with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive design.
- 🔹 **API Development & Testing**: All backend APIs are rigorously tested using **Postman**.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ **Input**: Users provide product details (name, category, etc.).

2️⃣ **Generation**: A SKU code is generated based on predefined rules (e.g., abbreviation, numeric ID, etc.).

3️⃣ **Display**: Products are shown on the website with their associated SKUs for easy tracking.

4️⃣ **Access Control**: Secure login system ensures only authorized users can create or manage inventory.
